		<p>The Covid-19 pandemic posed severe precarious challenges upon the mental health of adults in U.S., as the October 8 release of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention shows. </p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau obtained the mean severity scores of both depression and anxiety across 52 states/areas in the U.S., and the CDC used that data in its research to trace the trend of increase and decrease in the severity of both anxiety and depression across different time-periods during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The mean-scores of severity for both the conditions on 19th August, 2020 and June 7th, 2021 reveal that in 40 states/areas of the U.S., the severity of depression increased during the pandemic. 25 states/areas witnessed a likewise increase in the severity of anxiety among their adult-population. North Dakota witnessed an alarming increase of 69% in its mean severity of depression within its population during the pandemic, followed by Mississippi( 56%) and South Dakota(55%).</p>

<p>The increased physical isolation and restrictions upon movement that people have had to face during the pandemic, are usually cited as the major reason for increase in depression and anxiety among the adult population, across studies.</p>
<p>“Given that a substantial number of states reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms between August 2020 and June 2021, increased demand for psychological services are likely. States needs to further understand how to respond and prepare for increasing demands for psychological services,” said William Thompson, a scientist at CDC who was one of the co-authors of the MMWR report mentioned above.</p>
